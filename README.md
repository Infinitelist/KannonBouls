# KannonBouls

Boul Kanon set place in the sky or at the bottom of the ocean. The player is trying to see how long they can play the game. You collect three types of balls and a star in the process. Two cannons at the bottom corners of the screen shoot cannon balls. Your goal is to collect as many balls as possible. Be careful. If you miss a ball before it leaves the screen, it becomes a ghost. These characters will multiply exponentially and block your view of the balls. Clicking any of them, or if they fill the screen to a certain percentage, will cause you to lose the game. Try to click on the yellow star, as it appears to clear all the ghosts.

-- Proverbs 16:9
